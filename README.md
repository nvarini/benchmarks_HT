This is a set of small structures that aims to cover most elements and most symmetries (details below). As such, it can be used as a standard test for code benchmarking or for high-throughput computing (HTC) proposals. The structures are taken from the OQMD database (Vinay Ishwar Hegde, Chris Wolverton); for each formula selected, the lowest energy structure (i.e. the bottom of the convex hull) has been selected, according to the OQMD calculations.
